## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Challenge Mode Storage & Domain Models (Stage 1 Phase 1)**:
  - Created `ChallengeStore` in `src/storage/challenge.py` for creating deterministic challenge match seeds, managing capability tokens, and tracking persistent player attempts.
  - Added `challenge_sessions` table and unique constraint `UNIQUE(challenge_id, player_name)` to `LEADERBOARD_SCHEMA_SQL` in `src/storage/leaderboard.py` for persistent session resumption across server restarts.
  - Implemented Fog of War query methods in `LeaderboardStore` (`get_challenge_standings`, `get_challenge_round_guesses`, `get_challenge_participant_count`, `record_challenge_round_guess`, `finalize_challenge_player_match`).
  - Added challenge request and response Pydantic models in `src/models.py` (`ChallengeCreateRequest`, `ChallengeCreateResponse`, `ChallengeDetailResponse`, `ChallengeStartRequest`, `ChallengeStartResponse`, `ChallengeQuestionResponse`, `ChallengeAnswerRequest`, `ChallengeAnswerResponse`, `ChallengeLeaderboardEntry`, `ChallengeLeaderboardResponse`, `ChallengeRoundGuessData`).
  - Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_challenge_storage.py`.
- **Challenge Mode REST API & Service Engine (Stage 1 Phase 2)**:
  - Implemented `ChallengeService` in `src/game/challenge_service.py` to orchestrate deterministic asset selection with diversity sampling, pre-computation of frozen scoring decay constants (`location_decay_km`, `date_decay_days`, `map_bounds`), Album Shuffle batch pre-assignment and randomized pin assignment, secure question delivery, server-side timer grace window enforcement (`round_length + 5s`), answer scoring with frozen decay values, session advancement, and match finalization.
  - Created `/api/challenge/*` route family in `src/api/challenge_routes.py`:
    - `POST /api/challenge/create` for creating challenge match seeds with capability URLs.
    - `GET /api/challenge/{capability_token}` for public challenge details and participant counts.
    - `POST /api/challenge/{capability_token}/start` for starting or resuming deduplicated player sessions.
    - `GET /api/challenge/{capability_token}/question/{round_index}` for security-enforced sequential question retrieval.
    - `POST /api/challenge/{capability_token}/answer` for scoring answers and returning immediate personal reveals.
    - `GET /api/challenge/{capability_token}/leaderboard` for Fog-of-War filtered standings and opponent guesses.
  - Added `get_asset_answer(asset_id)` to `MetadataStore` in `src/storage/metadata.py` to query ground truth coordinates and capture timestamps for scoring.
  - Updated media proxy route in `src/api/routes.py` to authorize photo access for assets in active challenges via `ChallengeStore.is_asset_in_active_challenge`.
  - Wired `ChallengeStore`, `ChallengeService`, and `challenge_router` into application lifecycle in `src/main.py`.
  - Added automated test suite in `tests/test_challenge_api.py` covering all challenge endpoints, security constraints, scoring mechanics, and Fog of War visibility.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Photo Inconsistency Reporting & Source Links**:
  - Added "Report Issue" button (🚩) and accessible modal dialog to the round reveal screen across both Pinpoint and Album Shuffle game modes.
  - Three-field issue reporting: Inaccurate GPS / Map Location (`flag_coordinates`), Wrong Date / EXIF Timestamp (`flag_date`), and Free-text notes (`other`).
  - Active reporting player name attribution (`reported_by`) captured and persisted with each flagged asset.
  - Direct Immich Web link (`https://<immich-url>/photos/{asset_id}`) within the modal for quick source metadata editing in Immich.
  - SQLite persistent storage (`flagged_assets` table) tracking reported asset IDs, issue types, notes, reporting player, and timestamps with automatic migration.
  - REST API endpoints for flagging (`POST /api/assets/flag`), listing (`GET /api/assets/flagged`), and unflagging (`DELETE /api/assets/flagged/{asset_id}`).
  - Backend configuration safeguard `EXCLUDE_FLAGGED_ASSETS=true` (default: `True`) to automatically filter reported photos out of candidate pools without needing intrusive UI toggles.
  - Playwright E2E test suite for the reporting workflow (`tests/e2e/test_report_issue.py`).
  - Full bilingual localization (English & Brazilian Portuguese) for report modal and notification strings.
